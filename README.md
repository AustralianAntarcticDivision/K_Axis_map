This repository provides basic scripts for mapping the K-axis voyage and sampling stations using R

## Scripts
k_axis_map_script_1.R - a first crack at what this might look like

  ## Requirements
  Environmental data can be read directly using raadtools on machines
  connected to the AAD network, or if using a raadtools rstudio server
  (raadtools commands commented out in script). Otherwise, layers can
  be read locally by copying the files from the link below to your
  working directory:
